# KMeans Clustering

This repository contains an implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm in Python.

## Overview

KMeans is a popular clustering algorithm used to partition a dataset into `n` clusters. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, and the algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates the centroids until convergence.

## Features

- Customizable number of clusters (`n_clusters`)
- Maximum iterations (`max_iter`) to control convergence
- Random initialization of centroids
- Euclidean distance used for assigning clusters

## Installation

To use this implementation, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy
